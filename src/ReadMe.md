1.What is the Algorithm in Programming ?...................................................................................................................................

An algorithm in programming is a step-by-step procedure or a set of instructions designed to solve a specific problem, it provides a clear sequence of operations that a computer  can fallow to achieve a  desire out come .

2.Mention some of sorting algorithms (Arrange elements in order).


Bubble Sort- compares adjacent elements and swaps  them.
Selection Sort-Finds the smallest element and place it in order.
Insertion sort-Build the sorted array one element at a time.
Merge Sort- Recursively splits and merges sorted  subarray.
Quick Sort- Uses a pivot to partition and recursively sort elements.


3.Mention some of searching  algorithms (Arrange elements in order).
...Searching algorithm help locate elements in data structure.

Linear Search- Checks each element one by one.
Binary Search- Searches in a sorted array by dividing iit into havles.

4.Graph  Algorithms (Used for network , maps)


 Breadth-First Search (BFS)-Explore level by level.
 Depth-First Search(DFS)-Explore as deep as possible first.
 Dijkstra’s Algorithm – Finds the shortest path in weighted graphs.


5.Recursion-Based Algorithm (Self-calling functions)

Factorial calculation 
Fibonacci Sequence 
Tower of Hanoi

5.Dynamic Programming Algorithms (Optimized recursion)

Knapsack Problem
Longest Common Subsequence
Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

6.Greedy Algorithms(Chooese the best option at each step)

Huffman Coding (Data Compression)
Dijkstra’s Algorithm (Shortest Path)
Activity Selection Problem

Binary Searching Algorithm Explanation (Java)

What is the Binary Search ?

Binary search is a efficient searching algorithm used to find an element in a sorted array.it follows the divided and conquer approach, repeatedly dividing the array in half until the target element is found or the search  space is empty.
